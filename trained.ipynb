In the TCPIP CDEV, I had to manually assign an IP address, as Marinetti doesn't support getting an IP automaticaly from the gateway yet. I also manually gave it the IP address of the gateway (the QEMU VM), and used my ISP's router as the DNS server address. Left the username and password blank, clicked Connect, and lo and behold, I could see in the QEMU VM that the manual IP assignment had worked.It comes with a Telnet client, and a web _server_ (yes, you read that right).

      "WordWeavers for 19th May, 202419. How did you settle on your MC’s appearance?Short answer: I haven’t. I don’t actually describe my MC that much, in any of my writing. A few hints here and there, to clothing or hairstyle, but other than that, I kind of leave it a blank slate. This is deliberate – I want the reader to imagine the MC as they will, to suit their own preferences, and hopefully not be jolted out of the book when a bit of description doesn’t match what they imagined.I have ideas in my head of what my MC looks like, but it’s only vague, not pinned down precisely.Plus, I’m terrible at describing people… 😉 #WordWeavers #Writing #AmWriting #Fantasy\n",

      "RetroArch brings its free multisystem emulation to the iOS App Store - The Verge\"RetroArch isn’t an emulator but, rather, a front end that you can drop emulator cores into. So when you want to play a game, you need to load that game’s core first (although if you try to load a game with the wrong core, it will try to suggest the proper one for you). The app also has features like online gameplay, remapping buttons or keys per emulation core or per game, fast-forward and rewind, and gyro control.You’ll need to be on iOS / iPadOS 14.2 to run the new version of RetroArch or own a Vision Pro. It’s not available on the Mac version of the App Store, but that’s not a problem since there’s a macOS version (and versions for other operating systems as well) that you can easily download from the RetroArch website.\"(how do I get it to run a good version of Centipede?)https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157472/retroarch-emulator-ios-app-store-iphone-nintendo-sega-playstation-atari\n",

      "The clear result of five corrupt Republicans on the 1978 and 2010 Supreme Courts legalizing political bribery of politicians (and Supreme Court justices) by both corporations and the morbidly rich is that America is now well past the halfway mark of a fatal-to-democracy slide into oligarchy and the strongman autocracy typically associated with it—and the conflict that can follow.You can see the consequence in any contemporary survey. The majority of people want things—from a strengthened social safety net to a cleaner, safer environment to quality, free education—that Congress refuses to do anything about because it is in thrall to great wealth.For example, just last week, Donald Trump solicited a $1 billion bribe from a group of fossil fuel executives in exchange for undoing all of President Biden’s climate regulations.In a testament to how today’s form of transactional oligarchy has become normalized in America, the only national television news organization that reported this shocking story was MSNBC; every other news outlet thought it was entirely normal for an American politician to have their hand out in exchange for legislative or policy changes. What we are watching is the final stage of the 40-year neoliberal transition of our nation from a forward-looking and still-evolving democratic republic into a white supremacist ethnostate ruled by a small group of fascist oligarchs. https://newrepublic.com/article/181698/american-billionaire-oligarchs-drag-us-civil-war\n",
