The app also has features like online gameplay, remapping buttons or keys per emulation core or per game, fast-forward and rewind, and gyro control.You‚Äôll need to be on iOS / iPadOS 14.2 to run the new version of RetroArch or own a Vision Pro. It‚Äôs not available on the Mac version of the App Store, but that‚Äôs not a problem since there‚Äôs a macOS version (and versions for other operating systems as well) that you can easily download from the RetroArch website.\"(how do I get it to run a good version of Centipede?)https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157472/retroarch-emulator-ios-app-store-iphone-nintendo-sega-playstation-atari\n",

The majority of people want things‚Äîfrom a strengthened social safety net to a cleaner, safer environment to quality, free education‚Äîthat Congress refuses to do anything about because it is in thrall to great wealth.For example, just last week, Donald Trump solicited a $1 billion bribe from a group of fossil fuel executives in exchange for undoing all of President Biden‚Äôs climate regulations.In a testament to how today‚Äôs form of transactional oligarchy has become normalized in America, the only national television news organization that reported this shocking story was MSNBC; every other news outlet thought it was entirely normal for an American politician to have their hand out in exchange for legislative or policy changes. What we are watching is the final stage of the 40-year neoliberal transition of our nation from a forward-looking and still-evolving democratic republic into a white supremacist ethnostate ruled by a small group of fascist oligarchs. https://newrepublic.com/article/181698/american-billionaire-oligarchs-drag-us-civil-war\n",
