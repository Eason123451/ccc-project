      "Content: Reasons to ban llm stuff, per Gentoo Council member Michał Górny:“1. Copyright concerns.  At this point, the copyright situation around generated content is still unclear.  What's pretty clear is that pretty much all LLMs are trained on huge corpora of copyrighted material, and all fancy \"AI\" companies don't give shit about copyright violations. In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield stuff we can't legally use.2. Quality concerns.  LLMs are really great at generating plausibly looking bullshit.  I suppose they can provide good assistance if you are careful enough, but we can't really rely on all our contributors being aware of the risks.3. Ethical concerns.  As pointed out above, the \"AI\" corporations don't give shit about copyright, and don't give shit about people.  The AI bubble is causing huge energy waste.  It is giving a great excuse for layoffs and increasing exploitation of IT workers.  It is driving enshittification of the Internet, it is empowering all kinds of spamand scam.”\n",

      "Content: The clear result of five corrupt Republicans on the 1978 and 2010 Supreme Courts legalizing political bribery of politicians (and Supreme Court justices) by both corporations and the morbidly rich is that America is now well past the halfway mark of a fatal-to-democracy slide into oligarchy and the strongman autocracy typically associated with it—and the conflict that can follow.You can see the consequence in any contemporary survey. The majority of people want things—from a strengthened social safety net to a cleaner, safer environment to quality, free education—that Congress refuses to do anything about because it is in thrall to great wealth.For example, just last week, Donald Trump solicited a $1 billion bribe from a group of fossil fuel executives in exchange for undoing all of President Biden’s climate regulations.In a testament to how today’s form of transactional oligarchy has become normalized in America, the only national television news organization that reported this shocking story was MSNBC; every other news outlet thought it was entirely normal for an American politician to have their hand out in exchange for legislative or policy changes. What we are watching is the final stage of the 40-year neoliberal transition of our nation from a forward-looking and still-evolving democratic republic into a white supremacist ethnostate ruled by a small group of fascist oligarchs. https://newrepublic.com/article/181698/american-billionaire-oligarchs-drag-us-civil-war\n",
