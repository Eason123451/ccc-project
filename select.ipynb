What's pretty clear is that pretty much all LLMs are trained on huge corpora of copyrighted material, and all fancy \"AI\" companies don't give shit about copyright violations. In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield stuff we can't legally use.2. Quality concerns.  LLMs are really great at generating plausibly looking bullshit.  I suppose they can provide good assistance if you are careful enough, but we can't really rely on all our contributors being aware of the risks.3. Ethical concerns.  As pointed out above, the \"AI\" corporations don't give shit about copyright, and don't give shit about people.  The AI bubble is causing huge energy waste.  It is giving a great excuse for layoffs and increasing exploitation of IT workers.  It is driving enshittification of the Internet, it is empowering all kinds of spamand scam.‚Äù\n",
